### Step 0
You will need to download and install Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/. The "Community" version is what you'll need unless you already know wtf you're doing then you can do Visual Code and probably stop reading and get to fucking.

Whether it's during the install of Visual Studio, or after (will need to go to Start --> "Visual Studio Installer"), I believe you will need to manually let Visual Studio know to install these two items (though I'm not sure, I'm a c# Scrubdick McShitpiss so not really sure):
* .NET 5.0 Runtime
* .NET Framework 4.8 SDK

### Step 1
On you have VS installed. Go ahead and clone the project. I'd suggest putting the folder (or repo) on your desktop simply because that's where I've had it so there's fewer chances for unforeseen issues. 

### Step 2
In VS, 'Open Solution" then find ETF.sln

### Step 3
Modify any SearchTerm(s), Canaries or dates that you want. Let the program know if you want to use MultiSearch or not (by default I've left it on, just change it to false if you want a single search string)

### Step 4
Hit the green play symbol that says "ETF" next to it at the top. This will start and run the program.

### Step 5
Find the output file on your desktop under "ETF-Reports" (the program will tell you where to look once it's done in case you aren't sure).
